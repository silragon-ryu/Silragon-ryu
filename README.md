## 👤 About Me

I'm a disciplined and purpose-driven Computer Engineering student at **Istinye University**, deeply passionate about:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- 🔧 Embedded & Autonomous Systems  
- 🛠 Software Engineering & System Design  
- 🌊 Underwater Systems & OS-Level Simulation  
- 💻 Tools that promote self-mastery and long-term discipline

I currently work as an AI Research Assistant, lead automation development for an autonomous submarine prototype, and contribute to multiple medical AI research projects.

I aspire to build transformative technologies — from AI mentors to space-grade machines — that push the boundaries of what we believe possible.
